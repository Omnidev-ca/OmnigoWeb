This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Structure

### Core Files

- `src/app/page.tsx`: Main entry point for the application. Renders the Hero component within the main container.
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Root layout defining metadata and global structure.
- `src/app/globals.css`: Global CSS styles using Tailwind CSS.

### Components

- `src/components/Hero.tsx`: A React component that renders a 3D scene using React Three Fiber and Drei. Features a grid and orbit controls. This component is imported and used in `page.tsx` as the main visual element.
  - **Grid Hover System**: Uses an invisible detection plane that sits on top of the visual grid to reliably detect hover positions from any camera angle. When a grid square is hovered, a pillar appears at that position.
  - **Pillar Animation**: Pillars grow smoothly from the ground to a maximum height of 15px over a 1-second animation when a grid cell is hovered. Moving to a new cell resets the animation.
  - **Responsive Sizing**: Each pillar takes up an entire grid cell (0.5 Ã— 0.5 units) for better visual feedback.
  - **JSON Configuration**: Squares are generated from a JSON configuration, allowing for easy creation of multiple squares with customizable properties like position, size, and color.
  - **Variable Sizing**: Supports creation of squares and rectangles of any size by specifying width and depth in grid units.
  - **Grid Coordinate System**: Uses a consistent coordinate system with helper functions to properly position elements in grid cells rather than on grid lines.
  - **Fixed Camera View**: Features a fixed camera position looking at the center of the grid from an elevated position with a -15 degree Y-axis rotation.
  - **Beveled Blocks**: All blocks (pillars and configured squares) have smooth beveled edges for a more polished appearance.
  - **Edge Highlighting**: Buildings feature glowing edges that highlight their outline while maintaining a clean surface appearance.
  - **Interactive Highlights**: Buildings change their edge color to cyan (#7DF9FF) when hovered, creating a cohesive visual connection with the grid.
  - **Cyan Grid Lines**: The grid uses a bright cyan color (#7DF9FF) for improved visibility and aesthetic appeal.

### Configuration

The project uses a JSON-based configuration system to define squares on the grid:

```typescript
interface SquareConfig {
  position: [number, number]; // x, z coordinates
  size: [number, number];     // width, depth in grid units
  color: string;              
  highlightColor: string;     // Used for default edge highlighting (non-hovered state)
  name: string;               // For future implementation
}
```

The configuration allows easy definition of:
- Position in grid coordinates
- Size in grid units (supports rectangular shapes)
- Color properties
- Highlight color for default edges (cyan edge highlighting is applied on hover)
- Name (prepared for future features)

### Coordinate System

The project uses a grid-based coordinate system:
- One grid cell = 0.5 units in the 3D space
- Grid lines are positioned at integer coordinates
- Grid cells are centered between grid lines
- Helper functions ensure all elements are properly positioned relative to the grid

### 3D Functionality

The project uses several libraries for 3D rendering:

- **@react-three/fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei**: Helper components for React Three Fiber, including `RoundedBox` for beveled geometry and `Edges` for edge highlighting
- **three.js**: 3D library that powers the visualization

The `Hero` component contains a `Scene` function that sets up the 3D environment with lighting, a grid, and interactive controls.

### Camera Setup

The scene uses a fixed camera configuration:
- Positioned at coordinates [0, 10, 15] (centered, elevated, backed away)
- Points directly at the center of the scene (0, 0, 0)
- Has a -15 degree rotation in the Y axis for an angled perspective
- Field of view of 45 degrees for a natural perspective
